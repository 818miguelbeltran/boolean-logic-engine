# üßÆ Boolean Logic Engine

> *A Boolean logic model that tests rule-based decision-making using truth tables which is the foundation for algorithmic thinking and sociological system modeling.*

## üß† Logic Rule
**Recommend if (Genre Match AND High Rating) OR (Friend Liked AND NOT Genre Match)**  

This rule models decision-making for movie recommendations, testing how multiple conditions (preferences, ratings, and peer influence) combine to create outcomes.

## üìä Truth Table
![Boolean Logic and Truth Tables](./Boolean_Logic_and_Truth_Tables.jpg)

This table evaluates all 8 combinations of True (1) and False (0) values across three binary conditions. It demonstrates how algorithms make decisions based on rule hierarchies, an early foundation for understanding AI systems and surveillance logic.

## üíª Purpose
This project demonstrates **algorithmic thinking** by:  
- Translating logical conditions into structured **rule-based models**  
- Understanding **Boolean operations**, conditionals, and outcome hierarchies  
- Building conceptual foundations for **AI and sociological modeling of decision systems**

## üß† About This Project
This project was created to visualize the logic behind a **Boolean rule-based engine** that models how platforms make automated recommendations. The goal is to demonstrate how **decision-making (such as personalization and preference modeling)** can be structured logically and later implemented in code. By testing combinations of True/False conditions, this model reveals how algorithmic systems prioritize data inputs and how those priorities shape outcomes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The algorithm evaluates all possible combinations of **True (1)** and **False (0)** values across three binary factors:

- **Genre Match**  
- **High Rating**  
- **Friend Liked**

It then applies a logic rule that determines whether a recommendation should be made based on the data configuration.  
This method mirrors how digital systems ‚Äî like streaming platforms or social media feeds ‚Äî rank and filter results based on weighted logic and user data.  

This structure can later be translated directly into **Python** using Boolean expressions (`if`, `and`, `or`, `not`) and conditional statements to simulate real-time decision-making logic.

---

## üîÑ Future Directions
- Implement the logic rule in **Python** (`main.py`) for live simulation  
- Visualize outcomes using **decision trees or flowcharts**  
- Extend framework to model **algorithmic bias**, **classification systems**, and **automated surveillance decision-making**

## üîé Research Context
This project serves as a prototype for modeling how **algorithmic systems shape and constrain human decision-making**, a key theme in my sociological research on **surveillance, technology, and social control**. By dissecting how Boolean logic structures behavior in recommendation systems, this work highlights the **relationship between data, automation, and power** ‚Äî the foundation for understanding algorithmic governance in digital societies.
